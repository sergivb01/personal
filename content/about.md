Hi there, I'm **Sergi Vos Bosch** also known as **sergivb01** on the Internet. I'm **17 years old** and I'm based in **Catalonia, Spain**, therefore I speak **Catalan, Spanish and English**.

I'm a backend developer who specializes in **[Go](https://golang.org "The Go Programming Language")**, I'm currently attempting to learn Python, and **distributed systems** to advance my skill set.

I'm not very good at frontend work nor UI/UX design, but I'm learning more about **React and Vue** everyday.

But where I really shine is **DevOps and SRE**, anything that can be automated. But in my downtime I am learning more about other tools to make myself useful in other environments though.

I'm pretty knowledgeable in the world of cloud infrastructure as well with services like **[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ "Cloud Computing services | Google Cloud")** or [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.com/ "Amazon Web Services -  Cloud Computing Services").
