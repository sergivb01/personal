Hi there, I'm Sergivb01 also known as **Sergi Vos Bosch**. I'm **17 years old** and I'm based in **Catalonia**, Spain.

I'm a backend developer who specializes in **[Go](https://golang.org "The Go Programming Language")**, I'm currently attempting to learn Python, and **distributed systems** to advance my skill set.

I'm not very good at frontend work nor golang templating, but I'm learning more about React and Vue everyday.

I consider myself a backend developer not because I can develop a backend. But mainly because I do a lot of functional backend work which releases stress from the application and infrastructure.

But where I really shine is **DevOps and SRE**, anything that can be automated. But in my downtime I am learning more about other tools to make myself useful in other environments though.

I'm pretty knowledgeable in the world of cloud infrastructure as well with services like **[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ "Cloud Computing services | Google Cloud")** or Amazon Web Services.
