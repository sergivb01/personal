I'm a 17 years old software engineer based in Catalonia, Spain.

I enjoy coding **scalable**, **simple** and **robust** problem solutions. When I'm not coding you'll find me watching videos or series, or may be learning something new.

I love coding in [GoLang](https://golang.org/ "The Go Programming Language") and deploying into [Kubernetes](https://k8s.io "Kubernetes"), and building micro-services in order to create a fully working product.

I am currently learning:

* GoLang
* Kubernetes
* Amazon Web Services
* Google Cloud Platform
* Micro-services RCP

You can also find almost all the stack I've ever used in [Stackshare](https://stackshare.io/sergivb01 "My stackshare").
